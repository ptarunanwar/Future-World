        <h1> What is Virtual Reality? </h1>
        <img src="https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/roundups/02Qp8NssQCHrqFVFEOXnkxr-12.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1569492680.jpg">
        <p>What is Virtual Reality? Virtual reality means a near-reality experience, a three-dimensional (3D) generated environment where objects and scenarios seem so real the user feels as if they are immersed in their surroundings based upon sensory information and processes the brain uses to categorize information. This can be auditory (sound), visual (sight), or a mixture of both. VR devices allow you to experience a different reality with the help of a device known as a headset or virtual reality helmet. If you are presented with a form of reality that is not the current reality, your brain will still recognize that environment as a type of existence. Who knows how this can be transformed in the near future of VR technology?</p><br>

        <h1> VR vs. other Immersive Technologies </h1>
        <p>Immersive technologies are ones that attempt to create physical environments through simulated digital worlds. Immersive technologies include augmented, mixed, extended, and virtual reality.

        Augmented reality (AR) uses live video or a user’s current environment with the help of digital information to create semi-altered reality virtual objects overlayed onto the real-world environment. This is seen in some of the popular mobile games like Pokemon Go, where users can interact with characters on their smartphones in real-world environments. To experience AR you need either a mobile phone or AR headset.

        Mixed reality (MR) combines virtual and real worlds to create new environments, visualizations and other digital objects where the user can co-exist and interact with objects in these worlds in real-time. In other words, unlike AR’s overlays, virtual objects are anchored in the real world.

        Virtual reality (VR) is a seemingly real, digital environment that can be interacted with using special equipment, such as a virtual reality helmet or headset.</p><br>

        <h1>Current VR Usage in Different Industries</h1>
        <p>Virtual reality technology is making inroads into every sector. Finances Online conducted a study to determine which industries use VR more. With the help of this technology, the way humans entertain, treat, travel, learn, communicate, purchase items, and work will never be the same in the future of virtual reality.</p><br>
        <img src="https://nix-united.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/VR_graphics_03-1024x494.jpg">
        <p>The amount of VR users in the US is $57.4 million (eMarketer, 2020)<br>
           VR and AR investments were estimated to be $915 million in 2020 (Superdata, 2020)<br>
           91% of businesses are already leveraging or planning to adopt VR or AR technology (TechRepublic, 2020)</p><br>

        <h1> VR in Real Estate </h1>
        <p>As you can imagine, in this pandemic era, the possibility of showing virtual real estate has increased markedly. By putting on a virtual reality headset you can both observe the existing location and see how your property will look in the future when it’s done. The property could be located in another country, but you are still able to get a tour without leaving your own apartment. What could be easier than putting on a VR headset and wandering around your apartment?</p><br>
        <img src="https://www.encora.com/hubfs/REAL-ESTATE-ARVR-1.png">
        
        <p>Secondly, the client gets a unique opportunity to see the area, to understand if it’s spacious and comfortable enough to invest in. It’s also much easier for realtors to turn a client into a buyer when there is a certain level of emotional connection. Thus, with 360° filming of home space in VR, customers in their living rooms can see what their future home, which might be 1,000 km away from them, looks like. Or the client can see what the apartment or house will eventually look like instead of existing bare walls with the help of prototyping.

        A virtual room tour can encourage buyers to make a positive decision and invest. </p><br>

        <h1>VR in Manufacturing</h1>
        <p>The use of virtual technology in manufacturing provides significant improvements in cost, time, and quality. Product designers and engineers are able to explore options that in the past would have been prohibitively expensive or time-consuming.

        Since 2014, Ford has hired virtual reality specialists to lead engineers in designing and building entire vehicles, including autonomous vehicles, in a virtual environment. Today, Ford has a mandatory, multifunctional VR review for all vehicles that go into production.</p><br>

        <p>Imagine machinery equipment training, conducted with the help of virtual reality technology. The main purpose of such training is to increase the skills of the machine operators. In many countries you can start working as an operator only after passing an official exam and obtaining the necessary license; however, a license is not always the best indicator of manual skills. With new technology, in an environment in which even the slightest mistake is very costly, companies can be provided with a safe, easy, and relatively inexpensive way to train personnel.

        <h1>VR in Healthcare</h1>
        <p>Similarly, medicine, and especially emergency medicine, is not an environment where there is room for mistakes. Once they are put into a lifelike VR scenario, medical personnel can master all the needed skills and train every procedure with a realistic simulation of every emergency event from CPR to lumbar punctures. In addition to realistic graphics, this training can be equipped with a program that will evaluate the success of the training, mark all mistakes, and give advice on how to avoid them in the future.

        Medical training isn’t the only place where virtual reality technology is high. Mental treatment and disease awareness are also important aspects of VR in Healthcare.

        The ability of VR to place a person in any environment using controlled simulation creates an excellent instrument for physical and psychological treatment and pain management. Therapists already use VR in their practice to treating PTSD, anxiety, and phobias. VR takes its part in rehabilitation for patients who survived strokes, brain injuries, or other traumas. Gamification of the process plays a role here, which allows the patient to stay focused and place them in a familiar environment with reproduction of routines, such as driving, cooking, or other activities, allowing them to restore motor functions quickly.</p><br>

        <h1>Challenges with VR Uses in Business</h1>
        <img src="https://nix-united.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/VR_graphics_06-1024x576.jpg">
        <p>Major barriers such as lack of quality available content and poor user experience arise when it is impossible to find a competent vendor. For now and in the future of virtual reality it can be torture to find a decent vendor who will deliver good material that will assure users will be satisfied with their VR experiences and become customers.

        You should remember that VR, like any other software, requires data and privacy security. In addition, you must consider the type of solution, as it may require additional regulations, such as social networks in VR.</p><br>

        <h1>What to Expect in Virtual Reality by 2025</h1>
        <p>The 2018 report by the Capgemini Research Institute said “82% of companies that are currently in the process of implementing AR and VR solutions say the benefits are either meeting or exceeding their expectations.”

        Let’s explore what the future of VR technology holds!</p>

        <h1> Increasing Adoption in Remote Education and Training </h1>
        <p>To provide deep, immersive haptic feedback, Teslasuit, for example, already uses a full-body suit, enhancing immersion through the sensation of touch. It also offers a number of biometric sensors to measure heartbeat, sweat, and other stress indicators. This suit is designed to simulate experience and accelerate VR training with performance monitoring and sensation.

        Teslasuit is a powerful tool in XR training and already being used in training for NASA astronauts, but its potential is limitless. Of course, for now, such equipment is pretty high cost, but as the technology evolves, it should become more and more affordable.

        Because of COVID-19, distance learning systems are increasingly using virtual reality technology in education and training. The Engage platform is being used by companies such as Facebook, HTC, and the European Commission for distance learning. </p><br>
