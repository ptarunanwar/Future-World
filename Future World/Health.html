    <h1> The Future Of Health </h1>
	<h2> Brain Reading Robots </h2>
	<img src="https://futuristspeaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/futurist-speaker-thomas-frey-building-the-brains-of-the-robot.jpg">
	<p>Robots are here to stay, and they’re only getting smarter. But it’ll be a while until they respond to our every verbal command, so until then we’ll have to use our mind to communicate with them.</p><br>
    <p>The idea here is to allow machines to easily correlate and interpret the brain signals and hand movements of a person and turn them into quick robotic actions. That way, humans would not have to master coding skills required to preprogram robots to perform specific tasks in direct response to human interaction.</p><br>
    <p>The technology is still in its infancy and requires a human to wear a couple of cumbersome devices that would measure the electrical activity of the brain and the muscular activity of the hand. That’s how the robot “reads” our minds and muscle movements.</p><br>
	<h2> 3D Printed Bones </h2>
	<img src="https://i.all3dp.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=cover,w=1000,gravity=0.5x0.5,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/28163304/with-3d-printing-every-implant-looks-different-an-oem-update-200518_download.jpg"><br>
	<p>As a treatment, doctors implant bone grafts or bits of bone tissue from a donor. Held in place with wires and screws, inplants can help the body regenerate healthy bone structure.</p><br>
	<p>Unfortunately, this process has some evident flaws. First, the bone graft must be cut to fit precisely where the old bone used to be. Second, if metal plates or scaffolding are inserted during surgery, they usually have to be surgically removed later on. Lastly, for those missing a large amount of bone, such as in arms or legs, often the only option is to amputate the limb.</p><br>
	<p>3D printed bones could change all of that by making the process more natural and convenient for the patient. Doctors would no longer have to take a bone graft from another bone or search for a bone donor: They could simply scan the area and model the structure of the new bone.</p><br>
	<h2> Artificial Eyes </h2>

	<p>Scientists can’t yet rebuild someone with bionic body parts. They don’t have the technology. But a new artificial eye brings cyborgs one step closer to reality.</p><br>
	<p>This device, which mimics the human eye’s structure, is about as sensitive to light and has a faster reaction time than a real eyeball. It may not come with the telescopic or night vision capabilities that Steve Austin had in The Six Million Dollar Man television show, but this electronic eyepiece does have the potential for sharper vision than human eyes, researchers report in the May 21 Nature.</p><br>
	<p>The human eye owes its wide field of view and high-resolution eyesight to the dome-shaped retina — an area at the back of the eyeball covered in light-detecting cells. Fan and colleagues used a curved aluminum oxide membrane, studded with nanosize sensors made of a light-sensitive material called a perovskite (SN: 7/26/17), to mimic that architecture in their synthetic eyeball. Wires attached to the artificial retina send readouts from those sensors to external circuitry for processing, just as nerve fibers relay signals from a real eyeball to the brain.</p><br>
	<h2> Artificial Neurons on Silicon Chips </h2>
	<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e9/ba/0f/e9ba0f062c6eca63a20a6e133746ae80.jpg"><br>
	<p>Researchers have been attempting to develop artificial neurons for a long time. Such technology would be extremely useful in a wide variety of diseases and conditions. For instance, artificial neurons could be used to replace damaged neurons, such as those in spinal cord injuries, or dysfunctional neurons, such as those in the brain that fail to send the correct signals to the heart in cases of heart failure.</p><br>
	<p>However, biological systems are extremely complex and often unpredictable, and don’t easily translate into silicon hardware. Neurons receive electrical signals from other neurons, but don’t always respond predictably to these. However, these UK researchers used large-scale electrophysiological recording data to understand the activity of neurons so that they could successfully model their behavior on a silicon chip.</p><br>
