	<img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/lV6D2jqrOx/sizes/auto1cars5_resize_md.jpg">
	<br><p>This car is a force of nature, just pure unchecked power if you are lucky enough to get your hands on one, let alone afford one. It has been a while since the British brand, Lotus dropped a new vehicle, 11 years exactly. However, if you are a Lotus fan, this may be the car that you have been waiting for all these years. The new Evija, pronounced “e-VY-a”, is an all-electric hypercar that can push out an impressive 2000 horsepower without blinking an eye. However, let’s break that down even further.</p></br>
	<br><img src="https://inteng-storage.s3.amazonaws.com/img/iea/lV6D2jqrOx/sizes/auto1cars4_resize_md.jpg"></br> 
	<br><p>Each of the wheels on the vehicle has four motor-generators, producing 493 horsepower each, so roughly 2000 horsepower. And with all this power at your fingertips, expect the Evija to take you from 0 to 100 kph in under three seconds, with a top speed of 216 mph (349 kph). The vehicle also will have one of the fastest charging battery packs in the world, promising to charge its depleted battery to 80% in 18 minutes. Expect to get up to 249 miles (402 kilometers) off of one charge.</p></br>
